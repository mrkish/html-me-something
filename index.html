        <h1>Rock climbing? What's that? | A Brief Introduction to the Sport</h1>
        <p>It's just like it sounds -- you climb on rocks. More specifically, there are a number of sub-disciplines that you can explore, and the major differences are the means in which you protect yourself in the event of a fall.
            Since falling can be scary, the differences in how you stop or lessen the impact of a fall have a substantial effect on the difficulty of these disciplines.
        </p
        <p>
            I mainly do two disciplines, bouldering and sport climbing. A total view of climbing disciplines, including one that's not strictly using rocks, called aid climbin g, looks like this:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aid_climbing">Aid climbing</a></span> (which uses hooks and fixed ropes to ascend a rock face)</li>
                <li>
                    <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_climbing">Free climbing</a></span> (which you only ascend by using the actual rock):
                    <ul>
                        <br>
                        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_climbing">Traditional climbing</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_climbing">Ice climbing</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_climbing">Sport climbing</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouldering">Bouldering</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep-water_soloing">Deep water soloing</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_solo_climbing">Free soloing</a></li>
                        <br>
                </li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>There's enough distinction between these pursuits that I won't get into the details. But, generally, most people go outside
            and climb on rocks using ropes or what are called "crash pads", which are giant soft mats that protect you from impacting
            the ground. Outside I almost always have gone sport climbing, which involves clipping a rope you've tied into into "quickdraws"
            as you get higher up the rock face.</p>
        <p>OK -- I think the rough introduction is done. Let's dive into the list</p>

    <h2>Climb So iLL  |  St. Louis, Missouri</h2>
    <p>
        While I had gone climbing twice before at my college gym, and also at the two Upper Limits gyms in St. Louis, in a real sense this is where I started rock climbing. I still go here every week and do a mixture of climbing on their bouldering wall and sport climbing, which I usually do twice a week. My climbing partner is actually how I found out about LaunchCode; he had just graduated when we started climbing together and heavily suggested that I start the program once the next class opened up. I'm glad I listened!
    </p>
    <p>
        Aside from being a very nice gym, the other big attraction is the climbing community. Everyone is, basically, climbing against themselves, trying to improve their performance from the last time they were on the wall. Some people can get competitive, but you're really always trying to do your own best, and that's it. As a result the climbing community is generally very supportive and welcoming to everyone. Try it out if you haven't!

    <h2>Jackson Falls  |  Shawnee National Forest, Illinois</h2>
    <p>
    This area is the mainstay for locals wanting to sport climb without driving more than a couple hours away. It's a beautiful valley in the Shawnee National Forest near Marion, IL.
    </p>
    <p>
    Jackson falls is known for it's idiosyncratic style of climbing. Many of the routes are "cryptic", which means that the solutions to getting up the climb are not always obvious if you're unfamiliar with the area. That's actually a good thing, even if it doesn't sound (or feel) like it initially.

    <h2>Horseshoe Canyon Ranch  |  Jasper, Arkansas</h2>
    <p>
    Horseshoe Canyon Ranch is actually a ranch -- there are horses and goats that are kept on this privately-owned land. The area is also known nationwide for their "Horseshoe Hell" event, which is an event where thousands of people show up to climb for either 12 or 24 hours straight, sleep, and then party together.
    </p>
    <p>
    The ranch is beautiful, and the climbing is very inviting for someone who's mostly familiar with gym climbing. There are a lot of what are known as "chicken heads", which are large protrusions that are easily grabbed, along with a good mix of easy to moderate, and some harder, climbing routes. While it's largely a sport climbing destination, they also have a lot of bouldering.

    <h2>Red River Gorge  |  Kentucky</h2>
    <p>
    Red River Gorge is a mecca for climbing in the US. It's famous for it's steep, overhung walls, high-quality rock, ease of access, and Miguel's, a hugely popular pizza restaurant turned climbing store and camp ground.
    </p>
    <p>
    When I went here I wasn't really prepared for the experience. RRG has thousands of routes in a huge variety of styles, and tall, imposing walls. Having only gone to a few other locations, I quickly realized that climbing is so much more than just tying on to a rope in your local gym. This trip planted a seed for wanting to get more time outside on real rock, and for traveling to more areas across the US and the world.

    <h2>Siurana  |  Cornudella, Spain</h2>
    <p>
    Honesty I was just incredibly lucky to have this experience and opportunity. This area is considered one of the best sport climbing areas in the world, and people certainly know what they're talking about. The area is centered around a historic rock outcropping that has a beautiful old city, which was a historic stronghold of one of the Moors when the Christians were reconquering Spain. There's a spot near the old castle where the Moorish queen supposedly jumped off the cliff on her horse, which left a horseshoe print in the rock. That spot is called "La Salt de la Reina Mora", and there are climbing routes named after the story.
    </p>
    <p>
    We met people from all over the world here, the location is incredibly beautiful, and it's hard to find anything equivalent to the same old world feel these tiny, out of the way places have... probably because the United States simply isn't old enough, nor reverent enough, to have or keep many of those places.
