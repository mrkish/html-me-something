        <h1>Rock climbing? What's that?</h1>
        <p>It's just like it sounds -- you climb on rocks. More specifically there are a number of sub-disciplines that you can explore.
            I mainly two two: bouldering and sport climbing. A total view of climbing disciplines looks like this:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <span>Aid climbing</span> (which uses hooks and fixed ropes to ascend a rock face)</li>
                <li>
                    <span>Free climbing</span> (which you only ascend by using the actual rock):
                    <ul>
                        <li>Traditional climbing</li>
                        <li>Ice climbing</li>
                        <li>Sport climbing</li>
                        <li>Bouldering</li>
                        <li>Deep water soloing</li>
                        <li>Free soloing</li>
                </li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>There's enough distinction between these pursuits that I won't get into the details. But, generalaly, most people go outside
            and climb on rocks using ropes or what are called "crash pads", which are giant soft mats that protect you from impacting
            the ground. Outside I almost always have gone sport climbing, which involves clipping a rope you've tied into into "quickdraws"
            as you get higher up the rock face.</p>
        <p>OK -- I think the rough introduction is done. Let's dive into the list</p>

        While I had gone climbing twice before at my college gym, and also at the two Upper Limits gyms in St. Louis, in a real sense this is where I started rock climbing. I still go here every week and do a mixture of climbing on their bouldering wall and sport climbing, which I usually do twice a week. My climbing partner is actually how I found out about LaunchCode; he had just graduated when we started climbing together and heavily suggested that I start the program once the next class opened up. I'm glad I listened!
    </p>
    <p>
        Aside from being a very nice gym, the other big attraction is the climbing community. Everyone is, basically, climbing against themselves, trying to improve their performance from the last time they were on the wall. Some people can get competitive, but you're really always trying to do your own best, and that's it. As a result the climbing community is generally very supportive and welcoming to everyone. Try it out if you haven't!

    <h2>Siurana  |  Cornudella, Spain</h2>

    Honesty I was just incredibly lucky to have this experience and opportunity. This area is considered one of the best sport climbing areas in the world, and people certainly know what they're talking about. The area is centered around a historic rock outcropping that has a beautiful old city, which was a historic stronghold of one of the Moors when the Christians were reconquering Spain. There's a spot near the old castle where the Moorish queen supposedly jumped off the cliff on her horse, which left a horseshoe print in the rock. That spot is called "La Salt de la Reina Mora", and there are climbing routes named after the story.

    We met people from all over the world here, the location is incredibly beautiful, and it's hard to find anything equivalent to the same old world feel these tiny, out of the way places have... probably because the United States simply isn't old enough, nor reverent enough, to have or keep many of those places.
